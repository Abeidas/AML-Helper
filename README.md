# Guide to use AMLHelper  

1. Run AutomationML in the folder AutomationML\AutomationML Editor 

2. Under the menu item Plugin click on "AML Helper>Activate"

3. Using the menu item "Öffnen" open any .aml file in the folder Testphase\Testdateien 


# this following introduction of AML helper is a translated exempt from the specification sheet, the specification sheet can be found in the folder Definitionsphase in German.

## Problem
Manufacturing companies are dedicated to offer products of highest quality with the most possible low costs, and thereby to reach a high production rate, to maintain a high profit.
The production system, the product itself, the administration of the company, parts of the company's infrastructure, or the technological and logistical processes go through a constant change and age. This present for the company special challenges, since such changes, that often firstly happen in front of clients or suppliers, should be found and addressed as immediately as possible. This rarely doesn't mean the implementing restructures in the aforementioned areas of the company or products.
Traditionally changes are performed manually, which in many situations leads to interruption of production and thus fall in profit.
## Solution
Industry 4.0! Through cyber-physical subsystems, in which components communicate and perform independent decision, can the system become an autonomous unit, can collect data of the products, can supply real-time representation of the status in the production and can diagnose errors. A "smart factory", which can be as such designated, is able to modify sectors autonomically, without touching the rest of the units.
Actually, a research from AIDI shows, that a big part of costs for the automatization of a product is determined through the high cost of data transmission. Hereby it is particularly caused by, putting different systems to use during the processing and saving of information, which require a manual and inefficient transmission of data. Leading companies, such as Daimler, ABB, KUKA, Rockwell and Siemens, together with Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (KIT), as well as the university of magdeburg, have consequently begun to develop a unified standard format (AutomationML, shortly AML) for smooth and automatic exchange.
AutomationMl should be applicable in the entire production process and it should make it possible to save diverse information and thus to model complex products and systems.
## Purpose of this work
To help the dissemination of AML, should the creation of AML files take place as easy as possible. In particular, engineers without a background in information technology should be able, to create AML files without an elaborate training. Therefore, the aforementioned companies supply for the development of AML an official AMLEditor, in order to make it possible to create and process AML files. Unfortunately is the actual surface of the Editor, particularly for new users, confusing, complex and unattractive. To work against this and to simplify AMLEditor and make it more attractive, should a Plugin be developed with a sophisticated and intuitive surface. Thus, should a contribution be performed for the establishment of the AutomationMl format.


Unglücklicherweise ist die aktuelle Oberfläche des Editors insbesondere
für neue oder
fachfremde Benutzer und bei Arbeiten an komplexeren Modellen oft
unübersichtlich und
komplex und damit wenig attraktiv. Um diesem Mangel entgegen zu wirken und die Arbeit
mit dem AMLEditor
zu vereinfachen als auch attraktiver zu gestalten, soll ein Plugin mit
einer fortgeschrittenen, intuitiven Oberfläche und Benutzerführung entwickelt werden. Damit
soll ein Beitrag zur Etablierung des AutomationMLFormats
geleistet werden.
