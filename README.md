## Problem
Manufacturing companies are dedicated to offer products of highest quality with the most possible low costs, and thereby to reach a high production rate, to maintain a high profit.
The production system, the product itself, the administration of the company, parts of the company's infrastructure, or the technological and logistical processes go through a constant change and age. This present for the company special challenges, since such changes, that often firstly happen in front of clients or suppliers, should be found and addressed as immediately as possible. This rarely doesn't mean the implementing restructures in the aforementioned areas of the company or products.
Traditionally changes are performed manually, which in many situations leads to interruption of production and thus fall in profit.
## Solution
Industry 4.0! Through cyber-physical subsystems, in which components communicate and perform independent decision, can the system become an autonomous unit, can collect data of the products, can supply real-time representation of the status in the production and can diagnose errors. A "smart factory", which can be as such designated, is able to modify sectors autonomically, without touching the rest of the units.
Actually, a research from AIDI shows, that a big part of costs for the automatization of a product is determined through the high cost of data transmission. Hereby it is particularly caused by, putting different systems to use during the processing and saving of information, which require a manual and inefficient transmission of data. Leading companies, such as Daimler, ABB, KUKA, Rockwell and Siemens, together with Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (KIT), as well as the university of magdeburg, have consequently begun to develop a unified standard (AutomationML, shortly AML) for smooth and automatic exchange.
AutomationMl should be applicable in the entire production process and it should make it possible to save diverse information and thus to model complex products and systems.
